to find static files=>: withpython manage.py findstatic css => for css files
python manage.py findstatic js => to find js files
npm run relocate => gives django access to the index/css files within its build folder
=>React compresses the project and output a production-ready version in a folder called build. So what we’re doing with this new script is having React create the production build. Once that’s done, we want to move it over into the Django project. So we delete the old production folder with rm (-rf here means; r: delete everything inside the folder, f: don’t prompt, which is useful for us if there is no production build currently there. Otherwise, the command would stop). From there, we move the folder over to the Django project.=> below:
"/frontend/=> ../ back out and move it (mv) then remove(rm) the folder
"script":"react-scripts build && rm -rf ../backend/build && mv -f build ../backend".

=>When React creates its production build, it keeps all the CSS, JS, and other static files it needs to run in the build/static folder. You’ll also notice in our Django settings file we’re telling Django to look for static files in build/static (variable: STATICFILES_DIRS)

A crucial thing to remember is that Django’s development server (manage.py runserver) handles static files for you. To serve files in production, there’s a bit more configuration.

A quick note, if you’re trying to use Django’s Session Authentication with React by serving React under the same domain, do not use this method for development! You will bang your head against the wall creating the production build every time you make a change. Check out this article on using a reverse proxy to get Django and React under the same domain in development.

GOOD COMMANDS:
First of all, make sure that NPM is up-to-date.
npm i -g npm
CLEAN ALL:
remove node_modules folder and package-lock.json file
rm package-lock.json && rm -R node_modules
Remove dist folder:
 https://Clear npm cache :
npm cache clean --force
#Now reinstall the modules
then npm install
To see which version are installed :
npm ls webpack
GIT!:
git rm -r --cached node_modules
git commit -am 'ignore node_modules'
git commit -am 'ignore git'
#ADDING A SINGLE FILE:
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "adding ignore to git"
scale up site:
heroku ps:scale web=1 ( or web=2)

HEROKU RUNNING WEB LOCALLY: heroku local web -f Procfile.windows
Heroku:
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
your own git branch:
git push heroku (git repo/your branch):master

#EXISTING REPOSITORY
git remote add origin https://github.com/GaryBackEndElecEng/newMasterConnect.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
If your local changes are bad then JUST REMOVE THEM or reset your local master to the state on remote:
git reset --hard origin/main
python manage.py dbshell
  select * from django_migrations
   delete from django_migrations where id=361;
   react-meta-tags
column "allPaidInvoice" of relation "adminHome_suminvoice" already exists
To RESET DATABASE: use:
heroku pg:reset DATABASE => this will reset the database and then you must recreate it.NOTE: YOU CAN NOT DROP TABLES OR COLUMNS FROM HEROKU
TO REMOVE ADDED STATUS FILES FROM GIT :
git rm -f  "adminHome/migrations/0007_delete_suminvoice.py" 
/RUN COLLECTSTATIC
heroku run 'bower install --config.interactive=false;grunt prep;python manage.py collectstatic --noinput' 
GIT: CREATE A BRANCH OF  OF origin/main
git checkout -b myBranch origin/main
GIT: do a rebase:
to pull down any changes from origin/main:
git pull --rebase
GIT: TO PUSH THE CHANGES TO AREMOTE BRANCH:
git push origin myBranch
ISSUE:
"error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.mydomain.info/Product/product.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart."
SOLUTION: git push -f origin myBranch or git push -f origin
EXPLANATION:"You should pull down the changes from that remote branch and merge them into your local branch before pushing"
git pull origin , then git push 
fix: git push -f origin master , "With the -f tag ( force) you will override the remote branch code with your local repo code"
